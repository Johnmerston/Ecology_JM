#The following libraries are required for an FTIR plot
#for installing packages
install.packages("readxl")

install.packages("signal")

#The function of readxl is to import a .xlsx file into Rstudio - Use this library only if you have your date stored in a .xlsx file. 
#for data in form of a .txt file, upload the data into an excel sheet and then continue with readxl import

#ggplot2 is used for plotting the data obtained post processing through signal package
#tidyr package is used in this case for converting more than one line plot data into one single plot
#signal package is used to process the FTIR data - primarily for savitsky golay smoothening - Do read on window size and poly order if mentioned in any research article
